### Digital Design
- **ComeToCOM** is our final-year undergraduate project, dedicated to showcasing and promoting the Department of Media and Communication to the public. As a member of the project team, I took on the responsibility of designing all the graphic materials for our [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/come_to_com?igsh=MWNqZHBuYmZoNDgwNw==)

- **SocioHealth+** I undertook during my master's studies. The project involved collaborating with [Sarphati Cohort](https://www.sarphaticohort.nl/en/), a program focused on enhancing the health of children in Amsterdam through long-term research. Our specific task was to redesign their mobile app to address the unique challenge of collecting data from parents with low socioeconomic status (SES). As a member of the project team, I designed [a prototype of a mobile app](https://www.figma.com/proto/ab2OMRHgFlVZuy2LuCAMjv/Sarphati?type=design&node-id=70-167&t=ZHdvOAdFWkugrKv4-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A3509&starting-point-node-id=70%3A167), ensuring it catered to the needs and circumstances of the target audience.
