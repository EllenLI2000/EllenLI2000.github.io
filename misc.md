### Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
I am a typical [ESFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality) person!\
<img src="/img/MBTI.png" width=300>\
Being an ESFJ-T means that I possess a blend of extraversion, observance, feeling, and judging traits. These qualities make me naturally attentive and people-focused, always seeking opportunities to engage and make a positive impact. Whether through collaborations, conversations or simply being present in gatherings, I find fulfillment in building connections with those around me.

### Digital Design
With an academic background in media and communication, I was trained to deliver key messages through digital illustrations. I have had the opportunity to contribute to several projects where I took charge of the illustration design. Here are a few examples of my work:

+ **ComeToCOM** is our Final Year Project during my bachelor's studies, dedicated to showcasing and promoting the Department of Media and Communication to the public. As a member of the project team, I took on the responsibility of designing all the graphic materials for our [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/come_to_com?igsh=MWNqZHBuYmZoNDgwNw==)

+ **SocioHealth+** is the project I undertook during my master's studies. The project involved collaborating with [Sarphati Cohort](https://www.sarphaticohort.nl/en/), a program focused on enhancing the health of children in Amsterdam through long-term research. Our specific task was to redesign their mobile app to address the unique challenge of collecting data from parents with low socioeconomic status (SES). As a member of the project team, I designed [a prototype of a mobile app](https://www.figma.com/proto/ab2OMRHgFlVZuy2LuCAMjv/Sarphati?type=design&node-id=70-167&t=ZHdvOAdFWkugrKv4-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A3509&starting-point-node-id=70%3A167), ensuring it catered to the needs and circumstances of the target audience.

### Photography
I also indulge in photography as a means of capturing moments and emotions. Lately, I have been captivated by the serene atmosphere evoked by soft shades of pink and blue and obsessed with capturing its calming allure.

I compiled some of my photography work into a weekly calendar. Feel free to download the [good-for-print version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F6sl_bpiZ71OoGUSD-MQrsHQEdFBSow1/view?usp=sharing).
