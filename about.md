I am a research assistant at [**BiWell Lab**](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/lab.html), supervised by [Dr. Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/). As a researcher in the field of HCI, I design and evaluate Conversational Agents (CAs) in the context of people's daily health and well-being. Broadly, my research lies in the intersection of persuasive technology, digital health, social computing and personal informatics (PI). I aspire to establish inclusive human-computer relationships that empower individuals to cultivate their physical and mental well-being, where the computer acts as an enabler rather than the sole driver of optimization.
