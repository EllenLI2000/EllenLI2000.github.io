I am a research assistant at [**BiWell Lab**](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/lab.html), supervised by [Dr. Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/). As a researcher in the field of HCI, I design and evaluate Conversational Agents (CAs) in the context of people's daily health and mental well-being. Broadly, my research lies in the intersection of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW), Personal Informatics (PI), and Communication Science. I aspire to unveil the various possibilities of CAs to empower human well-being.
